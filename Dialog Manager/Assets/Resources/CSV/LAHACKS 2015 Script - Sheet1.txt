Heima	3	Jail cell	You opened your eyes and rose from your unconscious state. As you stood up and glanced around, you find yourself trapped behind iron bars. Nothing but stone walls surround you. You turn to your right and see a bunk bed. You aren't alone in here. On your bottom bunk, there lies an individual with pointy ears...		Next(4)

Cerise	7	Jail cell	She yawns and sits up on the bed.  “Hello.. my name is Cerise. Was just taking a nap to prepare for later tonight.”	“My name is Heima. But um... later tonight? What are you talking about?” you question.	Next(8)
Cerise_Annoyed	8	Jail cell	She scoffs.  “You intend to stay stuck in this cell? I’m getting outta here. You in?”	“I will accompany as your protector for I am the head knight after all… well at least I used to be.”  |  “No way baby, we got this cell all to ourselves ;) Stay with me, I'll give you a better escape.”  |  “Yes I would. I thank you for your generous offer. But may I also ask another favor ?”	Next(9)  ,  Next(_)  ,  Next(_)
Cerise_Annoyed/Stern	9	Jail cell	Cerise gives you a stern look, “Pft, don’t make me laugh. I can protect myself.” 	"By the way.. how do you intend to ahem... escape?" Heima whispers, realizing they were talking quite loudly. 	Next(10)
Cerise	10	Jail cell	Cerise rummages through her left pocket and pulls out a shiny key.  “Stole this key the moment those stupid guards threw me in. I had my hands untied the entire time... I’m the best assassin the world has to offer after all,” says Cerise arrogantly.  “Anyways, shh, I have been surveying the guard’s movements. They are always coming in pairs for safety reasons, but the next pair takes a while to pass by. We can immediately make our escape when one pair passes by… or we can kill them to relay a message to the others. I’ll let you choose, white knight.” 	"Kill them! I thought they were my brethren, but they all turned their backs on me the moment I was stripped of my power..."  |  "No way, I know them. I will not slay my own brethren."

Cerise	13	Jail cell	“So why are you here anyways?” 	You sigh, “The owner of this kingdom, King Leo II, had me thrown in jail.”	Next(14)
Cerise_Curious(one eyebrow up)	14	Jail cell	“Why?” Cerise asked with a curious expression.	“The king adopted me when I was a young child. I always looked up to him and I swore my loyalty and gave up my life to protect him.  He appointed me as head knight when I was 11 and was well known among everyone as the best knight that ever lived. As a result, I also took care of his daughter, Princess Camille.”  “One day while taking my daily stroll around the castle, I saw Camille heading towards her father’s room but she did not look her usual self... almost as if she was a completely different person. I noticed the cloth she was carrying had creases in the shape of knives. Without hesitation, I grabbed for the cloth and it ended with her pointing one of the knives at me, wanting to kill her father.”  “Because of the loud commotion, the king saw us and immediately warrant for our arrest. I felt completely lost when I realize the king did not trust me. Next thing I knew, Camille slit the throats of the two guards that tried to apprehend us, out of sheer panic. That was the last I saw of her…”	Next(15)
Cerise-Concerned	15	Jail Cell	“I’m sorry for your loss… “Cerise said sadly, looking down. It was not like she didn’t know what to say. She also suffered a lot. The best she could do was sharing her story.  “I am here because I made a stupid mistake when trying to assassinate your… king,” she hissed.  “A long time ago he came to my village and burned the whole place... It killed my parents. Ever since that day, the fire still burns in my eyes and trained myself to be an assassin. It was the only way I could survive and the only way I could one day seek my revenge. Our village had a special mark that only existed within our community.”   Cerise pulls up the cape draped around her left shoulder and reveals a crescent moon with a sword running through it horizontally. 	You panic at the sight of the marking. It looks like… “I… I have the same exact mark... but on my right shoulder…” you said as you pull up your right shoulder guard.  “The king always told me my parents died to a fire made by dragons… I was a fool, I trusted him fully…” 	Next(16) | Next(17) 
Cerise_Worried	16	Jail Cell	Cerise puts her hand on exposed right shoulder and looks at you with a worried face. “You and I aren’t as different as I thought…”  	You hear the sound of metal armor clanking against each other in the distance.	Next(17)
Cerise_Smug	17	Jail Cell	“Alright, get ready, it’s time to shed some blood tonight,” she whispered loudly with a smug look on her face.	As the guards pass by your cell, both of you were in your respective beds.  You felt a cool breeze past you as the door to your cell swung open. It barely made any sound, so the guards never turned around. 	Next(18)
Heima	18	Dungeon Hallway	You and Cerise quietly followed the two guards down the hall, matching their footsteps to avoid getting caught. Soon, both of you were hidden well in the shadows. Now it is your chance to kill them using what's around you.	Bucket | Torches on the wall | Swords on the guards	Next(19) | Next(20) | Next(21)
